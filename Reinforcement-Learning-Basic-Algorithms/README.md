# Reinforcement Learning Basic Algorithms

## Description
This repository provides the implementation of the basic reinforcement learning algorithms which we implemented as programming assignments of the [_online course_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-rl) on Coursera, including the honors track assignments.

This MOOC lasts 6 weeks and allowed us to implement different algorithms each week:
* Week 1:
* Week 2:
* Week 3:
* Week 4:
* Week 5:
* Week 6:

# Iteration Algorithms for Optimization

## Description

This repo describes and implements in Python 3 all the algorithms describes in the book [Iterative Methods for Optimization](https://my.siam.org/books/textbooks/fr18_book.pdf).

Iterative methods for optimization can be classified into two categories:
* line search methods
* trust region methods
